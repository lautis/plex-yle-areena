# Yle Areena plugin for Plex

This plugins provides content from Yle Areena to Plex Media Center. It embeds the flash player from Yle Areena site to Plex.

Using this plugin, you can view any freely available video from Yle Areena site. Category navigation and search interfaces are provided, but these are only quickly hacked together. User experience can probably be improved with some easy modifications.

## Installation

Copy this repository as `YleAreena.bundle` to `~/Library/Application Support/Plex Media Server/Plug-ins/`

## Issues/Todo

* Graphics/icons would be nice
* Video end detection only works for some videos
* Only videos can be viewed (better navigation for this?)
* Support for Yle Passi to view restricted content
* Play time is shown incorrectly
